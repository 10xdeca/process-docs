# Your Sprint Retro

**A Quick Guide for New Team Members**

## What's a Retro?

A retrospective happens at the end of every sprint. Think of it as a pit stop — we check what's working, what's not, and adjust before getting back on the track.

It's not a blame game. It's a safe space for the team to get better together, one sprint at a time.

## The Format: Start, Stop, Continue

You'll be asked to think about three things:

- **Start** — What should we begin doing?
- **Stop** — What isn't working?
- **Continue** — What's going well that we should keep doing?

## How the Session Works (60–90 mins)

1. **Set the Scene (5 mins)** — Ground rules, no-blame zone.
2. **Gather Data (15–20 mins)** — Add your thoughts to the board. One idea per note. Gut feelings are valid.
3. **Group & Discuss (20–30 mins)** — Cluster similar items, vote on what to discuss, everyone gets a say.
4. **Decide on Actions (10–15 mins)** — Agree on 1–3 action items. Each gets an owner. No owner = no action.
5. **Close & Appreciate (5 mins)** — Quick shout-outs. Positivity is fuel.

## Preparing (10–15 mins before the session)

Jot down 2–3 things for each category. Some prompts:

- What surprised you this sprint?
- Was there a moment you felt stuck?
- Did any process feel clunky?
- What was the highlight?
- Is there something you wish the team would try?

## Using AI to Help You Prepare

You're welcome to use AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini — whatever you prefer) as a brainstorming buddy. A great way to use them is to point them at your actual sprint artefacts:

> *"Here's my kanban board / sprint outline / GitHub activity for the last two weeks. Can you help me identify: what tasks were completed, what took longer than expected, what went well, what could be improved, and any wins worth celebrating?"*

This gives you a solid starting point for your sticky notes — just make sure the final points reflect your real experience in your own words.

## What Makes a Great Retro Participant?

- **Be honest** — Say what you actually think.
- **Be kind** — Critique the process, not the people.
- **Be curious** — Ask questions, don't assume.
- **Listen** — The best insights often come from someone else's perspective.
- **Follow through** — If you own an action, do it.

## Final Thoughts

Retros are how good teams become great teams. Don't worry about getting it perfect — just be honest, be kind, and be curious.

The best retro insight might come from the newest person in the room. That's you. Your fresh eyes are a superpower.
