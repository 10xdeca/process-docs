# Your Sprint Retro

**A Quick Guide for New Team Members**

## What's a Retro?

A retrospective happens at the end of every sprint. Think of it as a pit stop — we check what's working, what's not, and adjust before getting back on the track.

It's not a blame game. It's a safe space to get better together, one sprint at a time.

## How Our Retros Work

Everyone is working on their own project, so each person gives a short retro on *their* sprint. We then come together to discuss shared themes — processes, tools, and ways of working that affect everyone.

### The Format: Start, Stop, Continue

For your individual retro, think about three things:

- **Start** — What should you begin doing?
- **Stop** — What isn't working?
- **Continue** — What's going well that you should keep doing?

### The Session (1–2 hours)

1. **Set the Scene (5 mins)** — Ground rules, no-blame zone.
2. **Individual Retros (5–10 mins each)** — Each person talks through their sprint: what they worked on, what went well, what was tricky, and any wins. Keep it focused — you don't need to cover everything, just the highlights and the honest bits.
3. **Group Discussion (15–20 mins)** — After everyone has presented, we look for common themes across projects. Are multiple people hitting the same blockers? Is a tool or process helping everyone? This is where the shared learning happens.
4. **Decide on Actions (10–15 mins)** — We agree on 1–3 group action items for the next sprint — things like process changes, tooling improvements, or ways to support each other. Each action gets an owner. No owner = no action.
5. **Close & Appreciate (5 mins)** — Quick shout-outs. Positivity is fuel.

## Preparing (10–15 mins before the session)

Jot down 2–3 things for each category. Some prompts:

- What surprised you this sprint?
- Was there a moment you felt stuck?
- Did any process or tool feel clunky?
- What was the highlight?
- Is there something you wish you'd done differently?

## Using AI to Help You Prepare

You're welcome to use AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini — whatever you prefer) as a brainstorming buddy. A great way to use them is to point them at your actual sprint artefacts:

> *"Here's my kanban board / sprint outline / GitHub activity for the last two weeks. Can you help me identify: what tasks were completed, what took longer than expected, what went well, what could be improved, and any wins worth celebrating?"*

This gives you a solid starting point — just make sure the final points reflect your real experience in your own words.

## What Makes a Great Retro Participant?

- **Be honest** — Say what you actually think.
- **Be kind** — Critique the process, not the people.
- **Be curious** — Ask questions, don't assume.
- **Listen** — The best insights often come from someone else's perspective.
- **Follow through** — If you own an action, do it.

## Final Thoughts

Retros are how good teams become great teams. Don't worry about getting it perfect — just be honest, be kind, and be curious.

The best retro insight might come from the newest person in the room. That's you. Your fresh eyes are a superpower.
