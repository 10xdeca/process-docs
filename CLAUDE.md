# CLAUDE.md — Process Docs

## About This Repo

This is the team's process documentation repo for **10xdeca**. It contains guides on how the team works — sprints, retrospectives, and related ceremonies.

## Documents

- `sprint-guide.md` — Sprint overview: cadence, rhythm diagram, core principles, and links to ceremony docs
- `sprint-start.md` — Sprint Start guide: what happens, goal-setting, planning tips
- `mid-sprint-touchpoint.md` — Mid-Sprint Touchpoint guide: check-in format, scope adjustment, async option
- `sprint-retro.md` — Retro guide: format (Start/Stop/Continue), session structure, prep tips
- `backlog-grooming.md` — Backlog Grooming guide: when to groom, writing good items, common pitfalls
- `daily-standups.md` — Daily Standups guide: async format, what to share, tips
- `README.md` — Repo overview and onboarding entry point

## Sprint Cadence

The team runs **2-week sprints** on a Sunday-to-Friday cycle:

- **Sunday (Day 1)** — Sprint Start: set goals, commit to work
- **Saturday (Day 7)** — Mid-Sprint Touchpoint: lightweight check-in, blockers, scope adjustment
- **Sunday (Day 16)** — Retrospective (Start/Stop/Continue format), followed by the next Sprint Start

The retro and next sprint kick-off happen on the same Sunday.

## Retro Format

- Individual retros using **Start / Stop / Continue**
- Each person presents their own sprint (everyone works on their own project)
- Group discussion to find shared themes
- 1-3 action items with owners
- Session runs 1-2 hours

## Style & Tone

- Friendly, direct, and practical — written for team members, not managers
- Use clear headings, tables, and bullet points
- ASCII diagrams are used for visual timelines
- Keep guides actionable: "what happens" + "tips" for each ceremony
