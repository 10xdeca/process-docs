# Mid-Sprint Touchpoint

**Saturday — Day 7 of the Sprint**

---

## What Is the Mid-Sprint Touchpoint?

A lightweight check-in at the halfway mark. This isn't a status meeting — it's a course-correction opportunity.

The goal is simple: catch problems early so you have time to do something about them.

---

## What Happens

- Quick progress update from each person
- Identify blockers and offer help
- Adjust scope if needed — it's better to cut scope early than to scramble at the end

This should feel casual and quick. If everything is on track, the touchpoint can be very short.

---

## Key Questions

Ask yourself these before (or during) the check-in:

- **Are you on track for your sprint goal?**
- **Is anything blocked or taking longer than expected?**
- **Do you need help from anyone?**
- **Is there scope you should cut now to protect what matters most?**

Be honest. Saying "I'm behind" on Day 7 is useful. Saying it on Day 13 is too late.

## What "Adjust Scope" Means

Halfway through the sprint, you have real data about how the work is going. Use it.

| Situation | What to Do |
|-----------|------------|
| On track | Keep going — no changes needed |
| Slightly behind | Cut the lowest-priority task. Focus on the sprint goal |
| Significantly behind | Redefine what "done" looks like for this sprint. Flag it to the team |
| Blocked | Ask for help now. Don't wait and hope it resolves itself |

Cutting scope early is a sign of good judgement, not failure.

## Tips

- **Keep it short.** 15–30 minutes max. If there's nothing to discuss, end early
- **Focus on blockers, not status.** "I'm working on X" is fine, but "I'm stuck on Y" is more useful
- **Offer help.** If you're ahead and someone else is stuck, this is the moment to step in
- **Don't add scope.** The mid-sprint is for cutting or adjusting, not piling on new work
- **Use async if it works.** If the team prefers, this can be a quick message thread instead of a call — whatever gets the information flowing

---

## Async Option

If the team decides to run this asynchronously, each person posts a short update covering:

1. **Progress** — What's done, what's in flight
2. **Blockers** — Anything stuck or at risk
3. **Scope changes** — Anything you're cutting or rethinking

Post it in the agreed channel by end of Saturday. Read each other's updates and jump in if you can help.

*The mid-sprint touchpoint is your early warning system. Use it to steer, not just to report.*
