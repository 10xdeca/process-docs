# Backlog Grooming

**Keeping Your Backlog Ready for Sprint Planning**

---

## What Is Backlog Grooming?

Backlog grooming (also called refinement) is the ongoing process of keeping your backlog clean, prioritized, and ready to pull from. A well-groomed backlog means sprint planning is fast and confident — you're picking from items that are already clear, sized, and prioritized.

A messy backlog means sprint start becomes a grooming session, and that's a waste of everyone's time.

## When Does It Happen?

Grooming is **continuous**, not a one-time event. But there are natural moments for it:

| When | What to Do |
|------|------------|
| **During the sprint** | As you finish work or learn new things, update the backlog — add items, refine descriptions, reprioritize |
| **Before sprint start** | Spend 15–30 minutes reviewing your backlog so you walk into planning with clear options |
| **After retro** | Action items from the retro should land in the backlog with enough context to act on |

The key habit: **touch your backlog at least once mid-sprint**, not just at planning time.

## What a Grooming Session Looks Like

Whether you do this solo or with the team, the steps are the same:

1. **Review the top of the backlog** — Are the highest-priority items still the right priorities?
2. **Clarify vague items** — If you can't explain what "done" looks like, the item isn't ready. Add acceptance criteria or break it down
3. **Estimate effort** — Rough sizing is fine (small / medium / large). The goal is to know what you're committing to at sprint start
4. **Split big items** — Anything that would take more than 2–3 days should be broken into smaller pieces
5. **Remove stale items** — If something has been sitting in the backlog for months untouched, either prioritize it or delete it. Dead items create noise
6. **Add new items** — Capture anything that's come up — bugs, ideas, tech debt, retro actions

## Tips for Writing Good Backlog Items

A backlog item should be clear enough that future-you (or a teammate) can pick it up and start working without a 20-minute context download.

**What to include:**

- **Title** — Short and specific. "Fix login bug" beats "Bug fix"
- **Description** — What needs to happen and why. A sentence or two is usually enough
- **Acceptance criteria** — How will you know it's done? Be concrete
- **Size estimate** — Small, medium, or large. Refine as you learn more

**Example:**

> **Title:** Add password reset flow
>
> **Description:** Users currently can't reset their password if they forget it. Add a "Forgot password?" link on the login page that sends a reset email.
>
> **Acceptance criteria:**
> - "Forgot password?" link on login page
> - Sends reset email with a time-limited link
> - User can set a new password via the link
>
> **Size:** Medium

## Common Grooming Pitfalls

- **Grooming only at sprint start** — By then it's too late. You'll rush through planning or commit to vague work
- **Too many items** — A backlog with 200 items isn't a plan, it's a wishlist. Keep it focused
- **No acceptance criteria** — "Build the feature" is not a task. If you can't define done, you can't estimate it
- **Never deleting anything** — Old items rot. If it's been there for 3+ sprints and nobody's touched it, question whether it matters

*A clean backlog is a gift to your future self. Spend a little time on it regularly, and sprint planning becomes the easy part.*
