# The Sprint

**A Guide to How We Work**

---

## What Is a Sprint?

A sprint is a fixed timebox where we commit to delivering meaningful work. It gives us rhythm — a predictable cycle of planning, building, reflecting, and improving. No death marches, no endless timelines. Just focused two-week bursts.

Sprints come from the **Agile** framework — a set of principles that values working software, collaboration, and adaptability over rigid plans. The idea is simple: plan a little, build a little, learn a lot, repeat.

## Our Sprint Cadence

We run **two-week sprints** on a Sunday-to-Friday cycle.

```

                                  Retro
                                (next Sun)
```

| Event                | Day            | Purpose                                              |
| -------------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Sprint Start**     | Sunday (Day 1) | Kick off the sprint — set goals, commit to work      |
| **Mid-Sprint Touchpoint** | Saturday (Day 7) | Check in — are we on track? Any blockers?        |
| **Sprint End**       | Friday (Day 14) | Wrap up — what shipped? Demo the work               |
| **Retrospective**    | Sunday (Day 16) | Reflect — what worked, what didn't, what to change  |

> The retro falls on the Sunday *after* the sprint ends, giving everyone a day to decompress before reflecting. The next sprint then kicks off on that same Sunday, right after the retro.

## Sprint Start (Sunday)

This is where the sprint takes shape. The goal is to leave this session with a clear, shared understanding of what you're working on for the next two weeks.

**What happens:**

- Review the backlog and select work for the sprint
- Define a **sprint goal** — a short sentence describing what success looks like
- Break work into tasks and estimate effort
- Flag any dependencies or risks early

**Tips:**

- Don't overcommit. Protect 20% of capacity for the unexpected
- Each task should be small enough to finish in a day or two
- If a task feels vague, it's not ready — break it down or spike it first

---

## Mid-Sprint Touchpoint (Saturday)

A lightweight check-in at the halfway mark. This isn't a status meeting — it's a course-correction opportunity.

**What happens:**

- Quick progress update from each person
- Identify blockers and offer help
- Adjust scope if needed — it's better to cut scope early than to scramble at the end

**Key questions:**

- Are you on track for your sprint goal?
- Is anything blocked or taking longer than expected?
- Do you need help from anyone?

---

## Sprint End (Friday)

The sprint wraps up. This is about celebrating what shipped and being honest about what didn't.

**What happens:**

- Demo completed work (even if it's small — progress is progress)
- Review what was committed vs. what was delivered
- Move incomplete work back to the backlog with context on *why* it didn't get done

**Tips:**

- "Done" means *done* — tested, reviewed, and ready
- Unfinished work isn't failure. It's data for better planning next time

---

## Retrospective (Sunday)

The retro happens the Sunday after the sprint ends — a fresh start before diving into the next sprint.

### The Format: Start, Stop, Continue

For your individual retro, think about three things:

- **Start** — What should you begin doing?
- **Stop** — What isn't working?
- **Continue** — What's going well that you should keep doing?

### The Session (1-2 hours)

1. **Set the Scene (5 mins)** — Ground rules, no-blame zone
2. **Individual Retros (5-10 mins each)** — Each person talks through their sprint: what they worked on, what went well, what was tricky, and any wins
3. **Group Discussion (15-20 mins)** — Look for common themes across projects. Are multiple people hitting the same blockers? Is a tool or process helping everyone?
4. **Decide on Actions (10-15 mins)** — Agree on 1-3 group action items for the next sprint. Each action gets an owner. No owner = no action
5. **Close & Appreciate (5 mins)** — Quick shout-outs. Positivity is fuel

### Preparing for the Retro (10-15 mins)

Jot down 2-3 things for each category. Some prompts:

- What surprised you this sprint?
- Was there a moment you felt stuck?
- Did any process or tool feel clunky?
- What was the highlight?
- Is there something you wish you'd done differently?

> You're welcome to use AI tools as a brainstorming buddy to review your sprint artefacts and help surface insights — just make sure the final points reflect your real experience in your own words.

### What Makes a Great Retro Participant?

- **Be honest** — Say what you actually think
- **Be kind** — Critique the process, not the people
- **Be curious** — Ask questions, don't assume
- **Listen** — The best insights often come from someone else's perspective
- **Follow through** — If you own an action, do it

## The Rhythm at a Glance

```
        Sprint N                          Sprint N+1
┌──────────────────────────────┐   ┌──────────────────────────────┐
│  Sun ──────────────────► Fri │   │  Sun ──────────────────► Fri │
│   ▲            ▲          ▲  │   │   ▲            ▲          ▲  │
│ Start    Touchpoint     End  │   │ Start    Touchpoint     End  │
└──────────────────────────────┘   └──────────────────────────────┘
                                ▲
                              Retro
                            (Sunday)
```

Each sprint flows into the next. The retro closes one sprint and the sprint start opens the next — both on Sunday. This keeps our cycle tight and our learning continuous.

## Core Principles

1. **Commit to less, deliver more** — It's better to finish 5 things than to half-finish 10
2. **Make work visible** — If it's not on the board, it doesn't exist
3. **Raise blockers early** — The mid-sprint touchpoint exists for a reason
4. **Reflect and adapt** — The retro is where we get better. Take it seriously
5. **Respect the timebox** — The sprint has a start and an end. Protect both

*Sprints are how good teams build momentum. Plan, build, reflect, repeat.*
