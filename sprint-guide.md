# The Sprint

**A Guide to How We Work**

---

## What Is a Sprint?

A sprint is a fixed timebox where we commit to delivering meaningful work. It gives us rhythm — a predictable cycle of planning, building, reflecting, and improving. No death marches, no endless timelines. Just focused two-week bursts.

Sprints come from the **Agile** framework — a set of principles that values working software, collaboration, and adaptability over rigid plans. The idea is simple: plan a little, build a little, learn a lot, repeat.

## Our Sprint Cadence

We run **two-week sprints** on a Sunday-to-Friday cycle.

```
Week 1                          Week 2
─────────────────────────────── ───────────────────────────────
Sun  Mon  Tue  Wed  Thu  Fri  Sat  Sun  Mon  Tue  Wed  Thu  Fri
 ▲                             ▲
 │                             │
Sprint                    Mid-Sprint
Start                    Touchpoint
                                   ▲
                                   │
                                 Retro
                               (next Sun)
```

| Event                | Day            | Purpose                                              |
| -------------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Sprint Start**     | Sunday (Day 1) | Kick off the sprint — set goals, commit to work      |
| **Mid-Sprint Touchpoint** | Saturday (Day 7) | Check in — are we on track? Any blockers?        |
| **Retrospective**    | Sunday (Day 16) | Reflect — what worked, what didn't, what to change  |

> The retro falls on the Sunday *after* the sprint ends, giving everyone a day to decompress before reflecting. The next sprint then kicks off on that same Sunday, right after the retro.

## The Rhythm at a Glance

```
        Sprint N                          Sprint N+1
┌──────────────────────────────┐   ┌──────────────────────────────┐
│  Sun ──────────────────► Fri │   │  Sun ──────────────────► Fri │
│   ▲            ▲             │   │   ▲            ▲             │
│ Start    Touchpoint          │   │ Start    Touchpoint          │
└──────────────────────────────┘   └──────────────────────────────┘
                                ▲
                              Retro
                            (Sunday)
```

Each sprint flows into the next. The retro closes one sprint and the sprint start opens the next — both on Sunday. This keeps our cycle tight and our learning continuous.

And these practices support the sprint cycle:

## Core Principles

1. **Commit to less, deliver more** — It's better to finish 5 things than to half-finish 10
2. **Make work visible** — If it's not on the board, it doesn't exist
3. **Raise blockers early** — The mid-sprint touchpoint exists for a reason
4. **Reflect and adapt** — The retro is where we get better. Take it seriously
5. **Respect the timebox** — The sprint has a start and an end. Protect both

*Sprints are how good teams build momentum. Plan, build, reflect, repeat.*
